# Linked List Cycle
## Interview Question
Detect if a **singly** linked list has a cycle.
## Space / Time Complexity
We're not allowed to manually allocate any memory.

We're also being tested on the amount of time the function takes, from now on. It should be <= 40 seconds for a linked list of 1001 nodes, loop or not.
