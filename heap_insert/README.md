# Making a New Binary Tree Node and Inserting Number Into Heap

## Credits
For this project, the code in ``binary_tree_print.c`` and its prototype in ``binary_trees.h`` were copied from [Holberton's repository](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x1C.c).
The rest of ``binary_trees.h`` code and all of the test files were provided for us to use to test our code. Thank you, Holberton! God bless you all!

## Usage
Compile:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c <exercise_file>.c tests/<test_file>.c -o tests/<test>
```
Run:
```
./tests/<test>
```

## Exercises
- Create new binary tree node with parent, int, and no children
- Insert into heap
